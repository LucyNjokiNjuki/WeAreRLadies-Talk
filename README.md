# R-Ladies Global Rotating Curation on Bluesky: Amplifying African Voices in Data Science

## Connecting Through Code: My Week as a #WeAreRLadies Curator

### 26.04.2025

#### Abstract:
In this talk, Iâ€™ll share my experience curating the #WeAreRLadies Bluesky account - a week of storytelling, learning, and celebrating the diversity of the R community. From sharing my journey into R and the packages I love, to highlighting side projects, communities like rainbowR, and lessons from conferences like ShinyConf 2025, the experience offered a unique opportunity to reflect on my growth, connect with others, and uplift inclusive spaces within the R world. Iâ€™ll talk about what I learned, how I prepared content, and how curating sparked new connections and ideas - all powered by pipes, passion, and community. ðŸ’œ
